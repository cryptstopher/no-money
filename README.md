No Money is a very basic "cheap-ass" 1990s theme for WordPress.

## Suggested Installation

I suggest cloning this bad boy into your `themes` directory. That's
what I do. So whenever there's a change you can just do a `git pull`.

Or, you can download the zip and install it through your admin
area. _No need to force it in the back end._

## Style

No Money provides an optional post index with spinning globes alongside
posts.

Eventually, a conditional statement may provide a different icon
depending on the post category, or something like that.

Every page includes the square header with the pixel art beach and a
gif of Jerry Seinfeld in front of an old CRT monitor.
